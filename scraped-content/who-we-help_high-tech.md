# Salesforce For Firms Built on Recurring Revenue and Account Expansion

High-tech companies rely on subscriptions and long-term customer engagement. Whether you're offering a software product or platform, growth depends on more than just new sales. You need visibility from trial to renewal, structure across handovers and access to real usage data from your product platform.

We help software firms use Salesforce to track sales, renewals and key platform data in one place, supporting subscription models and giving teams a clearer picture of the customer lifecycle.

## Common challenges in high tech

### Trials and paid products aren’t tracked the same way

Teams often struggle to separate early-stage concepts from licensed deals. We help build opportunity structures that clearly distinguish trial activity, concept discussions and licensed sales, with a path to convert one into the other.

### Renewals are missed or left too late

Without structured tracking, it’s easy to lose sight of contract end dates or under-report future revenue. We set up renewal opportunities, alerts and dashboards to bring structure and forecast accuracy to subscription-based revenue.

### Customer data is trapped in the product platform

Seat counts, login frequency, feature usage and product tier often sit outside Salesforce. We manage integrations that bring this data into the CRM, giving sales and success teams visibility into what customers are using and when to act.

### Marketing needs to support onboarding and engagement

Tech firms often need to send welcome emails, usage reminders and onboarding tips. We set up transactional and behavioural email messaging through Salesforce Marketing Cloud to support activation and adoption.

# A roadmap that grows with you

Most clients start by improving sales pipelines, renewal tracking and visibility across customer types. From there, Salesforce can support:

- **Structured trial and paid opportunity tracking** Managing concept-stage, freemium or trial accounts separately from licensed sales

- **Revenue schedules tied to subscription terms** Reflecting ramped or deferred revenue in your forecasts

- **Platform integration for usage and login data** Bringing in product data to flag churn risk or support upsell conversations

- **Unified customer view through Salesforce** Making usage, billing and engagement data visible to sales and customer success

- **Transactional messaging for onboarding and engagement** Automating key communications to help customers activate and adopt your product


Every setup is shaped around your product model, sales process and growth goals, with room to expand as your platform and team scale.
