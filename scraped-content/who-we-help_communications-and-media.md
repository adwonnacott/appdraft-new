# Salesforce For Firms Who Grow Through Elevated Service And Recurring Revenue

Whether you're in telecom, broadband, digital media or a related service business, your growth depends on recurring revenue, strong customer care and visibility across accounts. From selling plans and managing upgrades to handling support and renewals, your teams need a clear view of customer activity to drive satisfaction and retention.

We help firms bring structure to their commercial and operational processes in Salesforce, aligning sales, service, product and subscription data in one place.

## Common challenges in communications and media

### Forecasting overlooks renewal opportunities

Without structured renewal tracking, it's easy to miss conversations that should already be in motion. We build pipelines and automations that raise timely renewal prompts and connect forecasts to contract terms.

### Support cases are missing from the commercial view

When teams can’t see complaint history, product issues or recent interactions, upsell conversations fall flat. We surface support records and customer care insights directly in Salesforce to inform renewals and upgrades.

### Upgrades and follow-on sales are hard to coordinate

Customers often need to expand or modify services, but tracking who has what and where the opportunities lie is difficult. We give sales teams better tools to identify and act on potential.

### Tariffs and bundles don’t fit standard quoting tools

We’ve worked with firms offering tiered services, complex pricing structures and bundled products. Our team builds custom product selectors and quoting tools inside Salesforce to reflect actual sales logic.

### Subscriptions live outside Salesforce

If you’re using third-party platforms to manage subscriptions, we integrate them. We push customer data out and pull back usage, billing or service status into one clear view.

# A roadmap that grows with you

We typically start with the essentials: sales pipelines, customer support and renewal tracking. From there, we can expand your system to support:

- **Renewal opportunity automation** Triggering follow-ups based on contract end dates, usage or service history

- **Custom quoting tools** Handling bundled products, tariffs and upgrade paths within Salesforce

- **Third-party subscription integration** Connecting Salesforce to platforms that manage contracts, usage or billing

- **Churn reduction and retention workflows** Using support data and account activity to flag at-risk customers

- **Unified reporting** Bringing sales, service and usage data into a single set of dashboards


Every solution is shaped around your customer model and technical stack, with room to adapt as your operations grow.
