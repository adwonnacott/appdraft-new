# You’ve Invested in Salesforce. Let’s   Make Sure it’s   Working for You

If Salesforce isn’t delivering, there’s usually a reason. In our experience, some organisations start with an implementation that never quite fits how the business operates. For others, what was originally a good match has drifted out of sync as the business has evolved.

## What a Health Check covers

We review whether your Salesforce setup still supports your business. That includes how the data is structured, how users interact with it, and whether you’re getting the visibility you need.

We focus on what adds value. That might mean quick wins, activating features that haven’t been used, or simplifying what’s already there. If parts of your workflow have drifted into spreadsheets or inboxes, we’ll help you understand why and how to bring them back into Salesforce.

A Health Check helps you understand the challenges, including the ones you’ve already noticed and the ones you haven’t. It gives you clear, practical options. There’s no pressure to act on the recommendations straight away. You can come back to us when the time is right.

## How it works

We start with a short call to understand your business. What you offer, how your team operates, and where the pain points are.

Then we review your Salesforce system in detail, using that context to guide the analysis. We’re looking not just at how the system is configured, but at how well it supports your processes and helps people do their jobs.

## What you get out of it

You’ll receive a clear, structured report that includes:

- A prioritised list of useful changes
- Budget estimates to help with planning
- Recommendations on what to address now and what to defer
- A realistic view of what’s working and where the gaps are

It’s a practical way to get clarity and unlock more value from the platform.

## When a Health Check helps

Users aren’t engaged with the system

Reporting is limited and key KPIs are hard to access

You’re deferring to spreadsheets to manage processes

The business has changed, but Salesforce hasn’t

You want to start with confidence before making bigger changes

> The Health Check gave us real clarity. We knew where we stood, what to tackle first, and what could wait.
