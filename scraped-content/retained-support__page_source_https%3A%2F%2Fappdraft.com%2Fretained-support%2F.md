## Questions Decision-Makers Ask

Clear answers about our retainer services

What if we don't use all our hours?+

Your hours never expire during your contract! Bank them for busier months, big projects, or just peace of mind. We track everything transparently, and you'll never lose unused time while you're a client. This is our key differentiator - we're spreading your cost of ownership fairly.

How does the contract work?+

We work on rolling 6-month periods. You commit to an initial 6 months, then another 6 months, and so on. This gives us time to properly understand your system, implement real improvements, and deliver genuine business value. It's not month-to-month - we believe in proper partnerships.

How quickly can you respond to urgent issues?+

During UK business hours, we respond within 4 hours for all tiers. For true emergencies outside business hours, we can arrange special support. Most issues are resolved same-day.

What if we need a big project done?+

You can use your banked hours for projects, or we can bill additional hours as overages at our standard retainer rates. Many clients use their regular hours to plan the project properly, then add extra hours for the build. It's flexible - we work with what suits you.

Why don't your hours expire?+

Because business isn't predictable. Some months you need 20 hours for a big change, others just 5 for maintenance. We believe in honest, transparent pricing - you're paying to spread the cost of ownership, not racing against a monthly clock. Your investment stays yours throughout the contract.
