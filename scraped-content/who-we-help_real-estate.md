# Salesforce For Firms Managing Properties, Buyers and Sellers

Whether you are selling, leasing or developing property, success depends on staying on top of every viewing, offer and client conversation. From tracking marketing activity to managing negotiations, we help real estate businesses use Salesforce to keep deals moving and relationships strong.

# Common challenges in real estate

### Property, buyer and seller data is scattered

When property details, buyer preferences and seller updates live in different places, it is easy to miss connections. We help you maintain clear, linked records of properties, buyers and sellers so you always know who is interested in what.

### Viewings and offers are not consistently tracked

Missed follow-ups after viewings can cost you deals. We build viewing tracking into Salesforce so every appointment, note and next step is recorded and visible.

### Offers and shortlisted purchases are hard to manage

Managing multiple interested buyers on the same property can be complex. We set up opportunity processes that record shortlisted purchases and track their status, whether they have been vetted, viewed the property or made an offer, so you can move each one forward efficiently.

### Integration with market tools is missing

Because Salesforce is API-first, it can connect with modern listing portals, valuation platforms and marketing tools to reduce manual data entry and keep your records up to date.

# A roadmap that grows with you

We usually start with the essentials: properties, buyers, sellers and offers. From there, your Salesforce system can support:

- **Property records**

Create dedicated Property objects to capture details such as location, type, size, pricing, status and key dates.

- **Property search and filtering**

Give internal users the ability to filter properties by type, location, status and other criteria to quickly find matching options.

- **Viewing management**

Log appointments, feedback and follow-ups in one place.

- **Offer and shortlist tracking**

Record shortlisted purchases, track their status (vetted, viewed, offer made) and maintain a full history linked to the property.

- **Marketing activity**

Track campaigns and enquiries from listing portals and digital ads.

- **Property and client portals**

Give sellers visibility on marketing activity, offers and feedback.

- **Reporting**

See your full sales and lettings pipeline, viewing-to-offer conversion and time-to-close metrics.


Every solution is tailored to your property operations, with a clear path to future growth.
