# Salesforce For Firms Managing Clients In  Regulated Settings

We help financial services organisations streamline client management, track opportunities from enquiry to completion, and maintain a clear compliance trail.

Whether you’re advising clients, brokering finance or managing assets, Salesforce provides a single place to manage your pipeline, documentation and approvals.

# Common challenges in financial services

### Client data is spread across emails, files and spreadsheets

We bring your client portfolio into Salesforce so you can see all interactions, documents and deal stages in one place.

### Opportunities need a process that matches real-world deal flow

We design opportunity stages that reflect how your business operates. For many brokers, an opportunity represents the process of securing a new client. Once the client is on board, a custom application tracking process can capture actual revenue figures based on commission amounts or other agreed terms.

### Lender applications are hard to track

Tracking which lenders have been sent applications, which applications have been made and the status of each is often manual and inconsistent. We’ve built custom solutions in Salesforce to track applications, their progress and their financial outcomes.

### Document handling is manual and inconsistent

We configure document generation and e-signature processes in Salesforce, making it easy for clients to receive, complete and return documents quickly.

### Compliance and audit readiness is difficult

We create a clear audit trail of client communications and document versions to support FCA compliance and internal audits.

# A roadmap that grows with you

We usually start by mapping how enquiries become opportunities and how those opportunities progress through to completion. From there, Salesforce can support:

- **Client portfolio management** Keep all contact details, history and related records in one system

- **Tailored opportunity processes** Match Salesforce stages to your specific client onboarding journey

- **Application tracking** Capture application details, track progress and calculate actual revenue

- **Document generation and e-signature** Produce and send documents for signing without leaving Salesforce

- **Compliance recordkeeping** Retain a clear audit trail for all communications and approvals

- **Reporting and dashboards** Create real-time views of pipeline, applications in progress and business performance


Every build is shaped around your service model and compliance requirements, so your team can work efficiently while meeting regulatory obligations.
