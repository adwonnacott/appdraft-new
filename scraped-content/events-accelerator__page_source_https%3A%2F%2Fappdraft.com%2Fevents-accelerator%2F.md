## Why Standard CRMs Don't Work for Events

Salesforce is a powerful platform that can transform how you run your events business. The challenge? Most CRMs - Salesforce included - are designed around straightforward sales processes: managing contacts, tracking deals through stages, closing deals. That works brilliantly if you're selling software licences or consultancy services.

But events businesses operate differently. Your "opportunity" isn't just a contact and a deal value - it's a room booking that needs to appear on a calendar, vendor coordination across multiple suppliers, complex payment schedules, setup requirements, and a dozen other moving parts that need to work together seamlessly. Standard CRM functionality simply doesn't address these specific challenges out of the box.

### The Challenges Events Businesses Face

#### 📅 Double Booking Prevention

Your calendar needs to be connected to your sales pipeline in real-time to prevent double bookings across multiple rooms and venues.

#### 📦 Complex Package Management

Room hire, catering, equipment, services with upsells and add-ons that need to be priced dynamically.

#### 🤝 Vendor Coordination

Tracking which suppliers are responsible for what across multiple concurrent events.

#### 💰 Staged Payment Schedules

Deposits, milestone payments, final settlements tied to event dates and milestones, not simple invoice terms.

#### ⚡ Efficient Inquiry Conversion

Moving from initial contact to detailed event planning without re-entering information.

#### 📄 Instant Professional Proposals

Pulling together room hire, services, equipment, and terms into professional PDFs instantly.

## What Is an Accelerator and What Does It Mean for You?

An accelerator is a pre-configured Salesforce solution built specifically for your industry. Rather than starting with blank Salesforce and spending months building everything from scratch, we've already created the foundation that solves the core challenges every events business faces.

This means you get up and running in weeks rather than months, and at a fraction of the cost of a traditional Salesforce implementation. Traditional implementations for events businesses can take months and cost tens of thousands of pounds. With our accelerator, you get the core system delivered in weeks.

### Where This Takes You: The Best of Both Worlds

This accelerator is your foundation - about 80% of what you need is right there from day one. But unlike off-the-shelf software that locks you in, you're building on the Salesforce platform with ultimate flexibility.

## What This Means for You
