# Salesforce For Firms  Delivering Care or Supplying Medical Products

We help organisations across the healthcare and life sciences sector, from those delivering direct patient care to those supplying regulated equipment and pharmaceutical products.

Our work ranges from supporting providers in managing appointments, patient records and consent to helping suppliers track orders, warranties and compliance requirements. Whether you are a healthcare team seeking to improve the patient journey or a distributor managing complex supply chains, we adapt Salesforce to fit your needs.

## If you work with patients, diagnostics or treatments

You need a platform that supports secure, end-to-end patient management, from initial referral and diagnosis through to prescription management and recovery tracking. Salesforce Health Cloud can be the right starting point for some organisations, offering a rich, structured data model and features for complex healthcare delivery. But for clients with simpler needs, we’ve also delivered custom Salesforce builds that cover everything from referrals and diagnostics to treatment workflows and patient symptom surveys.

We’ve helped organisations:

- Capture the right patient data at the right time with user-specific page layouts and field-level controls.

- Enable online and face-to-face appointment booking using **Salesforce Scheduler** and other integrated tools.

- Manage onboarding forms to collect **medical history and consent**.

- Create patient files that bring together clinical notes, diagnostics, treatment steps and communications.

- Use standard Salesforce approval processes to ensure the right clinical sign-off is captured for **prescription management**.

- Set up secure user-level permissions for clinical and support teams.

# If you manage medical devices, treatment products or pharmaceutical supply

For companies that supply clinical equipment or pharmaceuticals, visibility after the point of sale is critical. Whether you're delivering lasers for treatment or fulfilling regulated pharmaceutical orders, Salesforce helps you manage what happens beyond the sale, including tracking who is authorised to receive and handle equipment.

We’ve helped customers:

- Track where devices are, who uses them and what they need, including install locations, usage records and warranty eligibility.

- Ensure that only authorised clinicians or technicians are recorded as handlers for regulated-use devices.

- Handle licensed pharmaceutical orders with authorisation tracking at the account or contact level to ensure the person or organisation ordering is authorised.

- Log support requests, plan preventative maintenance and manage service contracts using Service Cloud.

- Build portals using Experience Cloud that allow distributors to submit leads, track opportunities and view pricing.

- Integrate with accounting platforms to surface billing history or key commercial data in Salesforce.
