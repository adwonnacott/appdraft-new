# Salesforce For Firms Who Sell Through Partners and Track Complex Products

Manufacturers don’t just sell. They quote, sample, negotiate, deliver and support. Whether you go to market through distributors, partners or direct sales, you need a structured way to handle product enquiries, track opportunities and support customers after the deal is done.

We help manufacturers use Salesforce to manage commercial workflows from first enquiry through to sale, order and service. That includes partner portals, sample tracking, product catalogues and post-sale handoffs to operations and finance.

# Common challenges in manufacturing firms

### Selling through partners needs more than spreadsheets

Many manufacturers rely on distributor networks, reps or agents to generate demand and close deals. We use Experience Cloud to build branded portals where partners can submit leads, track opportunities and view status updates. We've also built custom commission logic to support downstream payments and visibility.

### Opportunities don’t follow a standard sales process

For complex or engineered products, quotes often involve sample stages, technical review or staged pricing. We design opportunity processes that match how you actually sell, including product detail, sample tracking and commercial approvals.

### Converting sales into orders takes too many steps

Once a deal closes, the opportunity can generate an order record in Salesforce, streamlining internal handoff. If billing is handled in another system, we integrate it or sync invoice data back into Salesforce to maintain a complete customer view.

### Support needs structure and visibility

Customers still need help after the sale. We use Service Cloud to track support tickets, entitlements and any agreed warranty terms so your team has what they need to respond effectively.

## A roadmap that grows with you

We typically start by mapping out how leads and enquiries flow into opportunities, quotes and orders. From there, Salesforce can support:

- **Partner and distributor portals** Let partners register leads, track deals and view status updates

- **Sample and technical review stages** Reflect your real-world sales process inside Salesforce

- **Product catalogue and pricing logic** Manage detailed SKUs, pricing tiers and bundles as part of the quoting process

- **Opportunity-to-order automation** Create orders from closed deals and track fulfilment steps if needed

- **Accounting system integration** Sync invoices or billing data back into Salesforce to complete the customer view

- **Service-level tracking** Manage entitlements and support thresholds across different customers or products


Every setup is shaped around your actual sales process, not just Salesforce defaults.
