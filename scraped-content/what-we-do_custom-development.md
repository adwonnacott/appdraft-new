# Use Salesforce to Run More of Your Business

Salesforce is often seen as just a sales tool. But it’s a flexible platform that can support far more, including finance, operations, and specialist processes.

We help clients extend Salesforce to cover the day-to-day tools they need. That means fewer systems, less duplication, and a single place to manage everything that matters: sales, service, payments, and more.

## What we mean by custom development

Our aim is to build systems that your team can rely on and that genuinely support your goals. We’ve helped clients build:

- **Finance and procurement tools** Purchase order tracking, credit control workflows, payment scheduling, quote-to-cash automation

- **Operational and inventory systems** Inventory tools, asset tracking, project and task coordination

- **Specialist process platforms** Patient management systems and other tailored solutions for regulated or complex service environments


Some solutions are built entirely within Salesforce. Others involve integrating with third-party platforms to create a joined-up experience.

## Integrations and external services

Many of the most effective solutions rely on integration. We’ve delivered:

- Point-to-point integrations with external services

- Middleware-based solutions that are fast to implement and easy to scale

We also work with trusted partners and AppExchange tools, including document generation, accounting systems, and telephony, to help you connect what matters without overcomplicating the setup.

# Custom development makes sense when:

- You’ve outgrown spreadsheets or manual workarounds
- You’re using disconnected tools that make reporting or data entry a pain
- You’re switching between systems to complete simple tasks
- Your teams or processes don’t fit the standard CRM model
- You want to automate something that’s currently slow, repetitive, or error-prone

## Trusted partners and proven tools

We’ve worked with a range of trusted partners to extend what Salesforce can do. That includes:

- Document generation and e-signature platforms
- Accounting system connectors
- Payment processing and invoicing tools
- Telephony integrations
- Middleware for system-to-system automation

We don’t just plug things in. We help you choose the right tools, set them up properly, and make sure they work alongside what you’ve already built.
