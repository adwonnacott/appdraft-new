# Getting Started With Salesforce

We help you implement Salesforce in a way that fits your business today and scales with you tomorrow, keeping it simple where it should be and powerful where it counts.

Our job is to keep things proportionate. We focus on what matters now and build a foundation that supports future growth.

## How we run implementation projects

### Step One: Discovery And Process Review

We start by getting to know how your business works. We look at your current sales and service process and test it. If there are gaps or baked-in assumptions, we’ll challenge them. Our experience of managing sales and operations means we can strengthen your process before building anything around it.

### Step Two: Design Documentation

We produce clear documents that map out what we’re going to build. They capture what matters to you and reflect back the conversations we’ve had. It’s a chance to make sure we’re on the same page before we move into the build.

### Step Three: Sandbox Build

We build in a sandbox environment so you can try things out using test data. It gives you a safe space to explore the system and get a feel for how it behaves.

### Step Four: Show And Tell

Once the sandbox is ready, we walk you through how the system works. We explain the design, talk through decisions and make sure nothing has been missed.

### Step Five: Testing And Snagging

After the walkthrough, the system is over to you for testing. You can explore it in your own time, raise questions and flag anything that needs adjustment. We’ll handle refinements based on your feedback.

### Step Six: Go Live

When you're happy with how everything works, we move the build into your live environment. We’ll handle data import, user setup and any final steps to get you up and running.

Once you’re live, we offer flexible support. You can book help as and when you need it or arrange something more structured. Either way, we’re here to keep things moving.

## A proportionate approach

Some clients come to us with simple requirements. Others just want to get started with the basics and grow from there. That’s fine. We work with clients at all stages.

If your needs are more complex, we’re comfortable with that too. We’ve handled everything from multi-cloud rollouts to custom process automation and deep integrations.

We always encourage phasing work in a way that delivers value early on. We’ll help you focus on what matters now and build from there at your pace.
