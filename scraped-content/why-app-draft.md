# Practical Salesforce Expertise for Real Business Results

We are official Salesforce Consulting Partners with hands‑on experience across Sales, Service, Marketing and Operations.

From quick fixes to strategic projects, we help businesses get more from Salesforce by focusing on the outcomes that matter.

## Who We Are

Our background includes leading sales, operations and finance functions in both small businesses and corporate organisations. That experience means we understand the operational outcomes our clients are aiming for and can play an active role in defining system requirements.

We combine technical Salesforce knowledge with a clear understanding of business processes. Our approach is direct and focused on results, building systems that support your goals without over‑engineering.

## Our Approach

We take a proportionate approach to delivering effective change.

For smaller implementations and simpler systems, we develop quick concepts to help you decide what you need. For larger projects, we take the time required to get the right level of detail before building, no more and no less.

The speed of low‑code platforms like Salesforce means development can move quickly. We aim to deliver without slowing progress with unnecessary workshops or delays.

Our goal is for clients to see Salesforce as a platform they can evolve with confidence, knowing each project delivers improvements they can measure and build on.

## Proudly Part of Pledge 1%

We’re proud to be part of **Pledge 1%**, a global movement inspired by Salesforce’s 1‑1‑1 model- giving 1% of equity, product, time, and profit to make a real social impact

At Appdraft, our commitment is practical and diverse: supporting UNICEF, Crisis at Christmas, and Centrepoint; together with donations to client charities in recent years.
