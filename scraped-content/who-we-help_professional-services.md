# Salesforce For Firms Built on People, Processes, and Performance

Professional service firms rely on expertise, reputation, and strong delivery. Whether you provide advice, manage client work, or deliver ongoing services, your business depends on clear handovers, consistent communication, and visibility across the client lifecycle.

We work with firms across the professional services sector to design Salesforce systems that support the way you actually work. From first enquiry to final delivery, we bring structure to your sales, onboarding, delivery, and client service operations.

# Common challenges in professional services

### Forecasting is often incomplete

When income is predictable, such as under a retainer, forecasting is straightforward. But for firms with variable or project-based revenue, it often makes sense to integrate Salesforce with your accounting platform to bring in actuals. Where Salesforce handles operational delivery, we can also build billing directly into the platform.

### Onboarding needs more than a handover

Once a deal is signed, delivery teams need more than just a contact name. Billing models, key preferences, account history, and delivery notes need to be accessible at the account level. We make that part of the process.

### New work doesn’t always start with sales

Instructions often come in via email or support tickets. We use Service Cloud to help firms track and triage inbound work, so opportunities don’t get missed and teams stay aligned.

### Documents slow things down

Firms still lose time generating NDAs, engagement letters, and billing statements manually. We integrate document generation into your Salesforce workflow to reduce admin without cutting corners.

### Project visibility is limited

If project tasks and milestones sit outside the CRM, sales and service teams lose visibility. We help bring the right level of delivery tracking into Salesforce, without overcomplicating the system.

## A roadmap that grows with you

We usually start with the core: sales pipelines, onboarding, and service handling. From there, your Salesforce system can evolve to support:

- **Accounting system integrations** Bringing billed revenue into Salesforce to track performance and close the gap between forecast and actuals

- **Contract and document workflows** Automating client-facing documents such as terms, renewals, and statements

- **Delivery task tracking** Adding projects, milestones, or tasks where in-platform coordination is helpful

- **Lead nurture and outbound** Introducing marketing automation or simple campaigns to stay visible between engagements

- **Reporting and insight** Building dashboards to track pipeline, project delivery, and client engagement in one place


Every solution is shaped around your current operations, with a clear path to future growth.
