## Extend Salesforce to Your Customers and Partners

Experience Cloud lets you create secure portals, help centres and branded digital spaces that connect directly to your Salesforce data.

Whether you need to enable partner collaboration, customer self-service or internal sharing, it helps you give people access to the information that matters - without giving them access to your whole system.

## Why   Salesforce Experience Cloud?

Because it’s built on the Salesforce platform, Experience Cloud works with your existing data, processes and security model. That means external users only see what they should, and your internal team doesn’t have to manage data in multiple places.

With Experience Cloud, you can provide access to real-time CRM data, automate interactions, embed chat support, and use Agentforce AI to deliver smart, contextual assistance.

Salesforce Knowledge can act as both a searchable self-service resource for customers and a trusted data source for AI-powered support.

# What Experience Cloud includes

Experience Cloud is the framework for building branded sites that connect to Salesforce. It can be used to:

- Build help centres, service portals or knowledge hubs

- Give partners a place to log leads, track opportunities and access enablement materials
- Embed chat for live or automated support
- Share files, product documents or service updates securely
- Control access by user profile, account, product, or custom logic

Everything runs on Salesforce infrastructure, with mobile-ready design, real-time data and built-in security.
