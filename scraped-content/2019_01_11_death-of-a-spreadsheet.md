# The Death of a Spreadsheet

- adam

As every good tradesman will tell you, there’s a tool for
every job.

You wouldn’t use a calculator to do a job for a spreadsheet
(or vice versa, assuming you have a calculator to hand). By extension, with the
wealth of technology solutions available to business today, why do we continue
to rely so heavily on spreadsheets?

Up and down the country, office workers are busily tapping
data into and tracking data in spreadsheets; colour-coding cells and building
their own system in Excel.

## Data likes to be free

Some users will actively shun software systems in favour of
their spreadsheet; perhaps manually updating systems periodically.

In our experience, this happens for one or more of the
following reasons:

- The system provided is fundamentally unsuitable
for the task;
- The system is too slow or overloads with
information that the user doesn’t need;
- The system doesn’t have fields necessary to
track vital information;
- The user finds the system too difficult to
navigate or work with;
- The reporting from the system isn’t sufficient

These reasons can be distilled down to two main themes;
either the system isn’t good enough or the user experience hinders users and
slows them down.

Users like to manipulate data in their own way. Systems that
restrict the export of data or the number of reports that can be produced are
bound to spawn uncontrolled ‘workarounds’.

## The risks of going rogue with spreadsheets

Despite being the most widely-used business tool for
decades, spreadsheets can pose very real risk. Working with data in
unstructured systems means that users can delete or overwrite data by mistake
very easily. When the data is financial, the risk can be ‘lost’ or misstated
revenue, profit or assets.

Untested formulas or models can lead to errors being
accepted as reliable reports, upon which businesses can make critical
assumptions and decisions.

Spreadsheets are also regularly ‘socialised’ between
colleagues by email and, although most organisations encrypt communications and
control devices, the ability to transfer data in spreadsheet format (i.e.
outside of a system) can pose a serious information security risk.

Spreadsheets also open up the opportunity for deliberate
fraud. When field history isn’t tracked, it’s easier to hide fraudulent
behaviour than it is in an auditable system.

There is even a European organisation that highlights the risks
associated with spreadsheets, with some eye-watering examples of spreadsheet
errors that have cost billions of dollars and irreparable reputational damage ( [http://www.eusprig.org/horror-stories.htm](http://www.eusprig.org/horror-stories.htm))

## Using the right tool

With ‘low code’ development platforms like Salesforce, it
can take just days to produce basic applications to track records and produce
reports that are customised to user needs. With such short development
timeframes, it’s possible to meet specific needs for even the smallest teams or
functions within your organisation.

Salesforce applications can integrate with existing systems
of record and can push data back into those systems either on a scheduled
transfer or via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

Where teams are relying on spreadsheets, it’s generally
because they have either been overlooked (or perhaps not anticipated) when an
organisation designed its systems or it was too difficult or costly to meet
their needs in development.

With ‘lode code’ development, applications can be developed
up to 20 times faster than hard-coded systems; making it cost effective for
organisations adopting the Salesforce platform to deliver custom-designed
systems to meet all the user requirements in their organisation.
