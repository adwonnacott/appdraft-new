# Achieving Dig it al Tran sform at ion s w it h Low Code Developm ent

How 'low code' developm ent and Platform as a Ser vice infrastructure is helping businesses deliver connected, agile softw are applications

White Paper Apr il 20 19

# Introduction

This paper is intended to set out how organisations can (and are) leveraging Low Code developm ent on Platform as a Ser vice (?PaaS?) infrastructure to help expedite their digital tr ansform ation by delivering connected, intelligent business applications in a secure environm ent.

# W hat is Dig it al Transform at ion and w hat purpose does it serve?

?Digital Transform ation? is a bit of a buzzw ord. It?s one of those ethereal objectives that people talk about in boardroom s, but w hat does it m ean and w hy should you w ant it?

# Digital tr ansfor m ation can m ean:

# Meeting the expectations of custom ers

# B ein g b et t er at in t eg rat in g

Increasing ly tech-focused custom ers expect t hing s t o happen inst ant ly and ?rig h t f irst t im e?. They w ant an alw ays-on, ?digital?experience w here they can self-serve, use apps and t ran sact w it h ou t w ait in g for you r t eam t o m an u ally process request s.

Clien t s, supply chain p art n ers, d at a p art n ers, governm ent au t h orit ies; m o st forw ard-t hinking organisations are dig it ising t he w ay people can access t heir services. D ig it al t ran sform at ion is about accessing data f rom t h ird p art ies and providing inst ant access to your custom ers.

# Creat in g eff icien cies & enabling the w orkforce

# React ing to a changing m arket

Dig it al t ransform at ion involves review ing processes in a business t hat can be m ore eff icient ly carried out by system s t han people. It ?s also about allow ing your team s to focus on w orking on a m ore com plex level; or better serving your custom ers in a w ay t hat your system s w ill never be able to.

D ig it al t ran sform at ion is p art ly about having system s t hat are ag ile enoug h to react t o change. It ?s about seeing an opportunity in the m arket and being able to use ag ility of system desig n to t ake advant ag e of it , instead of concluding t hat your system s are holding you back.

In sum m ar y, w ell-executed digital tr ansfor m ations should br ing better custom er exper iences, m ore efficiency and a m ore resilient, reactive business.

# W hat is low code?

?Low code?is a m ethod of developing softw are or applications that keep the w riting of specific code to a m in im um .

On low code platform s, the m ajority of applications can be developed ?declaratively?by configuring options on the platform rather, than w riting code. The advantage of this is that it takes less tim e and is less expensive to develop functionality.

# Traditional Developm ent

# Low Code Agile Developm ent

There is little to no code to develop and test. If user testing determ ines that changes need to be m ade, these changes sim ply involve reconfiguring options on the platform . Building applications using low code can be betw een 6-20 tim es faster than traditional coding (according to Forrester TM). The freedom to m ake changes, test and change m eans that softw are developm ent becom es considerably less challenging.

Developing on low code platform s lends itself to agile developm ent m ethodology, w here the focus is on delivering useful features throughout the process and iterating, rather than agreeing the exact ?end goal?specification at the outset. Developing in this w ay is becom ing increasingly popular because it allow s the process to be m ore fluid and responsive to challenges. It also begins to deliver tangible value m ore quickly.

# W hat feat ures are com m on across low code plat form applicat ions?

Given that low code platform s tend to ser ve the needs of businesses seeking to build their ow n applications, they tend to have som e degree of com m onality w hen it com es to fun ction s.

Ty pi cal ly, l ow code pl atfor m s w i l l pr ov i de th e fol l ow i n g:

Relational database - Low code platform s allow user s to develop their ow n objects (the th i n gs th ey w an t to tr ack) an d th e f i el ds of data th at r el ate to th ose objects. Th er e w i l l usually be a relational elem ent, i.e. the ability to cross-reference and associate records of different types (e.g. m atching ?Patients?to ?Appointm ents?in a m edical records scenario);

Tracked com m unications - a m ethod of recording interactions, including call records, em ails (w ith var ying levels of integration) and docum ents;

Diary and task m anagem ent - the ability to create future tasks like m eetings or calls and dr ive r em inder s for these;

Pr of i l es/User r i gh ts - th e abi l i ty to deter m i n e di f fer en t ty pes of user pr of i l es th at provide right of access to groups of records w ithin the system and to edit/delete r ecor ds;

Reporting and dashboards - the creation of reports and, typically, dashboard view s th at w i l l r ef r esh f r om l i v e data i n th e pl atf or m ;

Connectivity - Low code platform s are alm ost alw ays configured to be ?open?, w ith m oder n Appl i cati on Pr ogr am m i n g I n ter f aces ('API s') th at w i l l per m i t l ive tr an sfer of data betw een system s.

Addi ti on al ly, som e pl atfor m s w i l l pr ov i de featur es l i ke:

Autom ation - the autom atic creation or updating of records based on changes to other r ecor ds or ti m e tr i gger s; Portal view - the option for external user s (typically custom ers or partner s) to access their records and, subject to perm issions, m ake edits;

- Skills-based routing - pushing w or k to team m em ber s based on acknow ledged skill sets (e.g. technical know ledge or language capability) or based on w or kload capacity relative to other team m em ber s (pushing w or k to the least busy!); Ar ti f i ci al I n tel l i gen ce - AI al gor i th m s th at w i l l h el p pr edi ct outcom es or suggest actions, based on historical data experiences;
- Mobile user experience - the ability to access applications in an app, to com plem ent a desktop user experience.

Low code platfor m s are designed to cast a w ide net. There m ight be literally thousands of use cases for low code system s, ranging from finance applications, custom er relations, HR, legal, operations and other functions w ithin a business.

As such, the high level functionality of these system s is designed to cope w ith the diverse needs that an individual custom er m ight present.

# Low Code Developm ent vs ?Off shelf?Softw are

Softw are tends to be designed for a specific use case, w ith a hypothetical custom er in m ind. Whether it?s a case m anagem ent platform for a firm of law yer s or an em ployee online com m unity; the softw are provider w ill have a list of features designed to m eet the com m on needs of the law yer or HR m anager.

But w hat happens if you?re not the 'aver age' law yer or HR m anager? There w ill typically be an elem ent of flexibility and configuration and som e system s ar e better th an oth er s.

How ever, in order to keep im plem entation ti m ef r am es to a m i n i m u m , u ser s m ay f i n d th at softw are provider cannot m eet their requirem ents.

I n m ost cases, th er e w i l l be som e for m of com prom ise or w orkaround.

Som e softw are developer s have recognised this lim itation and m ore and m ore provider s are h osti n g th ei r ser v i ces on l ow code pl atfor m s to per m i t m or e f l exi bi l i ty.

# W hat is Plat form as a Service?

PaaS allow s businesses to run applications w ithout having to m aintain hardw are i n f r astr uctur e on th ei r si te.

The platform takes the strain of things like updates and netw or k security m onitoring. Business continuity w ith PaaS is also m uch easier because applications can be accessed from anyw here in the event of a datacentre outage.

PaaS provides all the infrastructure needed to develop and run applications over the Internet. User s can build their ow n softw are applications on PaaS and access them in the cloud.

# Key advantages of PaaS include:

# Im proved Perform ance and Reliability

When user dem ands of running softw are increase, on-prem ise hardw are can star t to str uggle. If system s are on a go-slow it can be really frustrating for team s and it m eans your business is less pr oductive. I f your staf f ar e w atch i n g th e ti m er on th e scr een , they?re not getting things done! With PaaS that burden is on high-perform ance rem ote ser vers, so users don?t exper ience delays w hen usage spikes.

# Increased Dat a Security

With PaaS, ser vers are located in enterprise datacentres w ith restricted access. They have failover capability across different sites so that if a datacentre is com prom ised, one of m any others can take the str ain. Security for cloud infrastructure is as good as it can get. PaaS providers host cr itically confidential financial, m edical and even gover nm ent records in environm ents that m eet ISO 27001standards.

# Increased Flexibility

When ser vers are hosted on site, the business w ill often be required to buy and install m ore hardw are as needs increase. With PaaS, there is effectively unlim ited room for expansion to m eet future needs and, again, updating that infrastructure is no longer the user ?s responsibility.

# Conclusions

Digital transform ation is som ething that ever y business needs to prioritise.

The pace of change in the past decade has been extraordinary as businesses battle w ith the need to m eet custom er expectations w hilst preser ving m argin. There are plenty of industry new s stories relating to businesses that have failed to adapt to changing m odels. In m any cases, these failures are for the w ant of new technology.

The businesses that w ill sur vive are undoubtedly those that im prove efficiency through autom ation of tasks and those that can learn from and deliver better custom er exper iences using that data insight.

Low code developm ent on PaaS infrastr ucture is becom ing a real front-runner for businesses that need to m eet these challenges.

Moving to PaaS platform developm ent m akes it easy to build applications for even sm all gr oups of user s, w i th out goi n g out to m ar ket for an ?of f th e sh el f ? sol uti on . I t f aci l i tates constant innovation and allow s prioritisation of functionality and design, over w riting code.

It m eans that users don?t need to ?settle? for softw are and they don?t need to w ait for developer s to build from scratch. Developm ent and updating system s can becom e an ongoing process, supporting continuous im provem ent.
