# AI Assistant Policy

## 1\. Introduction

Appdraft Limited provides an AI-powered assistant (“AI Assistant”) on this website to help visitors find information, ask questions and navigate our services. The AI Assistant is offered as a convenience tool - not a substitute for professional advice or direct communication with our team. By using the AI Assistant, you accept the terms set out below.

## 2\. Nature of AI-Generated Responses

The AI Assistant uses large-language model technology to generate responses. Although we configure its use, it may sometimes produce:

- inaccurate or incomplete information

- responses that do not represent Appdraft Limited’s views

- misinterpretations of your query

- outdated or misleading guidance


Because of this, you should **not** rely solely on AI-generated content for decisions that affect your business, finances, legal position or any other significant matter.

## 3\. Not Professional Advice

The AI Assistant does **not** offer legal, financial, medical or other professional advice. It provides general guidance only. You should independently verify any information before acting on it.

## 4\. Data Collection & Privacy

When you use the AI Assistant, any information you provide - including personal data - may be:

- captured by Appdraft Limited,

- retained in conversation logs for quality control, auditing, and service improvement.


We handle this data under the terms of our existing Privacy Policy (see below).

**For full details about what data we collect, how we use it, who processes it and your rights under UK data protection law, please refer to our Privacy Policy: https://appdraft.com/privacy-policy/**

## 5\. Liability & User Responsibility

By interacting with the AI Assistant, you acknowledge that you - not Appdraft Limited - are responsible for how you interpret and act on its responses. Appdraft Limited is not liable for any loss, damage or consequences resulting from reliance on AI-generated content, except where such liability cannot be excluded under UK law.

## 6\. Availability & Changes

The AI Assistant is provided “as is.” We do not guarantee accuracy, completeness, or uninterrupted availability. Appdraft Limited may modify, restrict or withdraw the AI Assistant at any time without notice.

## 7\. Escalation to a Human

If your enquiry is complex, sensitive, business-critical or requires personal attention, please contact us directly using the details below.
