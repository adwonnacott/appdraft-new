# AI Where it Counts, Inside your CRM

Salesforce Agentforce helps your teams move faster and your customers get what they need. It works directly on the data you already hold in Salesforce, guiding internal users through their day-to-day work or supporting customers with instant answers and next steps.

It’s not just artificial intelligence. It’s intelligence applied where it can make the biggest difference, inside a system built to serve your customers.

## Why Agentforce?

There are plenty of AI tools on the market. But if they don’t have access to your data, and they can’t do anything with it, what’s the point?

Agentforce is different. It runs inside Salesforce and works with the data already in your system: your customer records, cases, emails, activities and product data. That means it can take meaningful action, help users make decisions, and spot things a human might miss.

Rather than floating in a chat window or sitting outside your workflow, Agentforce is designed to be useful right where the work happens.

## What Agentforce can do

Agentforce helps with the kinds of jobs that usually slow people down. It can:

- Review a case and highlight key points from email history
- Summarise long activity logs into clear status updates
- Draft a tailored email based on a record or recent interaction
- Spot missing data or inconsistencies in key fields
- Guide users through quoting, triage or onboarding steps

Everything runs inside Salesforce, using your existing flows, objects and business logic.

## Get started faster with Salesforce-built Agents

Salesforce offers a growing library of ready-to-use Agentforce templates, including:

- **Service Agent**: supports customers across multiple channels, answers questions using your knowledge base, and creates cases when needed

- **Sales Development Agent**: sends outbound emails, answers inbound queries, and engages leads using your live data

These can be tailored to fit your specific process and business rules.

# How we make it work for you

We help shape Agentforce into something your business can use with confidence. That includes:

- Defining what the agent should read, understand and act on
- Designing actions that run inside Flow, Apex or Lightning pages
- Connecting it to your knowledge base, documents or website content
- Testing responses to ensure accuracy and value
- Training your team to use it effectively

We focus on solving real problems, not just ticking the AI box.

## When Agentforce makes sense

Agentforce makes sense when:

- You want to help customers get faster answers
- You want to reduce time spent reviewing long records or case history
- You want the system to suggest updates or next steps based on data
- You want to cut down repetitive manual tasks
- You want AI to fit the way your business already works
