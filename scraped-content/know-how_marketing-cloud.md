# Smarter Campaigns, Connected Journeys

Salesforce Marketing Cloud helps businesses turn marketing activity into real pipeline. Whether you're running lead nurture programmes, personalising outreach at scale, or fixing handover gaps between marketing and sales, we help you make it work.

We support clients using both **Marketing Cloud Growth Edition** and **Marketing Cloud Account Engagement.**

## Why Salesforce Marketing Cloud?

**Marketing Cloud Growth Edition is built natively on the Salesforce platform.** That means your sales, service and marketing teams can all use the same up-to-date data without sync issues or complexity.

It uses **Data Cloud to segment intelligently** and deliver journeys in real time. Account Engagement remains a strong option for B2B teams who want to qualify leads, automate follow-ups, and measure engagement across the sales cycle.

## What Marketing Cloud includes

We help clients set up and improve both platforms. Key features include:

- Multi-channel campaign automation
- Form and landing page creation
- Lead scoring and grading
- Real-time tracking and attribution across channels
- Segment building and campaign logic

## How we help

We work with clients to make Salesforce marketing tools usable and effective.

That includes:

## When Marketing Cloud makes sense

- You’re already using Salesforce, but marketing is still disconnected
- You want to equip sales with the context they need to tailor follow-up and spot buying signals
- You need intelligent ways to segment leads and launch campaigns at the right time
- You want marketing and sales to work together across the full customer lifecycle, not in separate stages
- You want to stay visible after the sale and support onboarding or customer care through targeted content

# Already using Salesforce?   Then you should be using Marketing Cloud

If your marketing isn’t connected to your CRM, you’re missing out on better targeting, stronger engagement and more reliable pipeline.
