✅ Cadences for Structured Outreach – Standardised sequences of calls and emails ensure leads are followed up properly.

✅ Work Queue for Efficiency – Moves reps away from disorganised lead lists to a prioritised, daily task queue.

✅ Intelligent Lead Scoring – Helps reps focus on the leads most likely to convert.

✅ Call Scripts & Automated Emails – Ensures reps say the right things and send optimised messages.

✅ Managerial Oversight – Track engagement, refine processes, and cut ineffective steps to boost conversion rates.
