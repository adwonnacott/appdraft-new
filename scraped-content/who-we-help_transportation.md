# Salesforce For Firms Managing Jobs, Resources and Customer Requests

In transportation and logistics, every job matters. From the moment a customer makes a request to the final confirmation of delivery, success depends on visibility, coordination and clear communication.

We help organisations use Salesforce Service Cloud as a foundation to bring job tracking, resource allocation and customer updates together in one connected platform.

# Common challenges in transportation and logistics

### Jobs are tracked in too many places

When job details, customer communications and status updates are spread across different tools, things get missed. We help bring all job management into Salesforce so your team and customers always know where things stand.

### No clear handoff from request to job creation

We set up Salesforce Service Cloud so new job requests are captured as Cases, creating a clear starting point for every piece of work. From there, jobs and any related consignments or items can be tracked through to completion.

### Internal processes are difficult to follow

From packaging to warehouse moves and storage, operational work can be hard to track without a shared system. We help create job records for these internal tasks so nothing is lost.

### Document management is slow or manual

Contracts, proofs of delivery and job schedules are often handled outside the core system, which slows down work and increases risk of error. We integrate document generation and eSign into Salesforce so you can create, send and store documents without leaving the platform.

### Customers cannot see their own jobs

The option exists to use Experience Cloud‑powered portals to give customers the ability to view and update their jobs, providing greater transparency and reducing status queries.

# A roadmap that grows with you

We usually start with job tracking and communication, then expand to support:

- **Job and consignment tracking** Link jobs to consignments and items, recording every movement and status change.

- **Resource management** Track and assign drivers, vehicles and other resources directly in Salesforce.

- **Field updates** Allow drivers or field staff to update job status from mobile devices, whether via Salesforce Field Service or simpler mobile forms.

- **Customer communication threads** Keep all emails and messages linked to the job record so customers and staff can see the full history.

- **Web service channels** Capture job requests from web forms, chat, or other digital channels directly into Salesforce.

- **Customer job tracking** The option exists to use Experience Cloud‑powered portals so customers can view and update their jobs.

- **Document generation and eSign** Automatically generate job sheets, delivery confirmations, contracts or proof of collection documents from the job record, and send them for electronic signature to speed up approvals and confirmations.
