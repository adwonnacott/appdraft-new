# “Training Issue” + “User Error” = Bad System Design

‘It’s a training issue’. ‘I’m
afraid it’s user error’. We hear these justifications frequently in a customer
service environment when something goes wrong. But how often should we really
be attributing ‘user error’ to bad system design?

Whilst it might be idealistic to
say that the right system can design-out all propensity for error, it’s
certainly true that systems can be used to minimise it.

The first step in reducing error
is to measure complaints. Businesses need adequate reporting of complaints and
the ability to confidently diagnose issues. Root cause analysis can be used to
help identify common themes.

Whilst it can be tempting to
categorise complaints as having a basis in ‘user error’, think about whether
the root cause is poor system design. If it is, putting issues in a ‘user
error’ bucket might just be glossing over more fundamental issues in your
process.

## How can good system design help reduce ‘user error’?

### Invalid data entry or missing data

Is your system permitting users
to enter data in the wrong format? Can users submit records without entering
data in fields that should be mandatory? Are users selecting options and entering
data that isn’t relevant to the case or type of record?

Salesforce Validation Rules can
make fields required and can prevent entry of data that is not compatible with
a defined rule. For example, if the validation rule allows a number between
1-10, it will prevent entry of a value of ‘11’. These types of rule can also be
dependent on other fields or the seniority of the user, making the application
of validation rules very effective at controlling the quality of data.

### Incorrect calculations or logic

Are users expected to calculate
totals or grade records? Are they expected to remember different client
preferences? Manual calculations can be an opportunity for error. Salesforce
enables users to define calculated fields based on complex formulas, or a
series of formulas. Think about all ‘freehand’/editable fields in your system.
Is there a way to drive a value, based on data that already exists in the
system?

### Templates and automation

Does a certain type of customer
request or input/event always require the same action or series of actions? If
so, Salesforce Process Builder can be used to automate the process. Process
Builder can be used to send templated communications, send internal alerts,
create tasks and create or update records based on field changes or customer
online requests. If processes aren’t suitable for full automation and require a
judgment call, Salesforce can make it easy for your users to initiate a process
with a button click.

### Providing training materials in context

Are ‘training issues’ arising in
your organisation on a regular basis? Is there a gap between the knowledge of
senior team members and new starters?

Most organisations provide
training on a periodic basis. We teach our users once, or once every six months
and expect them to retain that information. For some, it’s difficult to
understand and remember everything. Your team supervisors can become overrun
with questions; or worse, your team members guess the answer to their own
questions.

With Salesforce Knowledge, teams
can create and share Knowledge Articles and display these in the context of
certain records. Article creation can follow a process to ensure information is
correct and Articles can be updated as necessary. Users can be presented with
‘suggested articles’, based on the activity they’re completing within the
system.

Salesforce Knowledge moves
organisations away from expecting users to know and remember everything. With
contextual hints and suggestions, it’s like having a supervisor shadowing your
team members all the time.

## Agile development using Salesforce

Moving to Salesforce
applications, or optimising Salesforce applications for your business can help
design-out error in your organisation. There’s nothing more frustrating than
compromising customer relationships by repeating the same mistakes; especially
if they seem easily avoidable.

It’s not always reasonable to
expect team members to work to 100% accuracy; but you can apply that
expectation to an IT system. That’s why organisations should be constantly evaluating
processes and determining whether work that’s carried out manually would be
better automated (or at least partly automated).

With Salesforce, users can
quickly make those process changes. Salesforce users aren’t beholden to
software developers and protracted development timetables; they can take an
agile approach to designing out error. Many Salesforce organisations look to
make monthly or quarterly releases to improve their systems and will look to
their teams to propose and ‘upvote’ development changes; giving front-line
users the ability to influence the priority order of improvements.
