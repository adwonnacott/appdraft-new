# Support That Scales With Your Business

Salesforce Service Cloud gives you a proper system for managing customer service.

It replaces shared inboxes and lightweight tools with a structured platform for logging, assigning and resolving support requests.

## Why Salesforce Service Cloud?

Most companies start with Sales Cloud. But as customer needs grow, and requests come from more places, keeping track of service becomes harder.

Service Cloud gives your team a central place to manage support, with the structure, automation and reporting to help them stay on top of everything. It supports email, phone and web as standard, with options for online chat and WhatsApp, and routes cases to the right team or queue based on your own rules.

It is scalable, adaptable and designed for service delivery that keeps up with your customers.

It includes:

- Case management, assignment and intelligent routing to the right team
