# Plan and Deliver Work in the Field

Salesforce Field Service helps businesses plan, deliver and track work carried out in the field. Whether you manage installations, maintenance, inspections or repairs, Field Service brings scheduling, job information, and field updates into a single platform.

We implement Field Service so your team can deliver work efficiently and keep customers informed every step of the way.

## Why choose Salesforce Field Service?

Smarter Scheduling

Optimise the use of your resources with tools to assign the right person, with the right skills, at the right time. Field Service scheduling can account for location, travel time, skills and availability to reduce delays and wasted trips.

Better Comms

From the moment a job is assigned, your field staff can see all the information they need, including job details, location, related assets and customer history. Updates from the field flow straight back into Salesforce for office staff to see in real time.

Fewer Missed Appointments

With appointment reminders and status updates, customers know when to expect your team. This improves the customer experience and reduces no-shows.

Connected Operations

Link Field Service with Service Cloud so cases, work orders and appointments are part of the same process. Job completions can trigger service reports, invoices, follow-up work or customer surveys.

Mobile-friendly Working

Field teams can access and update jobs using the Salesforce Field Service mobile app. This includes completing checklists, capturing photos, getting customer signatures and logging time and parts used.
