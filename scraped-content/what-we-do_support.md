# Help When You  Need it. Guidance When it Counts.

As your business evolves, your Salesforce setup should evolve with it. Our support services help you fix issues, make improvements, and keep moving forward, whether you need help now and then or ongoing assistance each month.

# Choose the model that's right for you

## Pay-As-You-Go Support

Many of our clients use pay-as-you-go support as an ongoing way to keep their system working for the business. There’s no contract or commitment. Just direct access to the same consultants who built your solution.

We help with admin tasks, configuration changes, advice, and iterative improvements. You get a detailed breakdown of time spent, billed accurately in six-minute units without rounding up.

## Retained Support

Some clients prefer a more structured approach. With a retained plan, you have a set number of hours available each month and a clear agreement in place to support your internal team and roadmap.

This works well when you're driving regular change, supporting a large user base, or want predictable access to experienced support without having to think about scope each time.

## From tickets to transformation

Support isn't just about fixing issues. It's also about keeping your CRM healthy, useful, and aligned to your goals.

Under a support plan, we can help you:

- Review system usage and spot underused features
- Adjust user permissions or security settings
- Keep data clean, structured, and report-ready
- Roll out iterative configuration changes
- Document your setup for continuity and audit
- Sense-check roadmap ideas and provide input on timing

Whether you're working reactively or proactively, support is about making progress.
